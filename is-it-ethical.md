## Working Title: Navigating the Ethical in Collecting Social Media Data

## Intro
- Several institutions collecting social media
 - Serious discourse
 - Social movements
 - Institutional records
- Growing concern over our ethical obligations
 - Show some tweets
- Groundwork for understanding some of the ethical issues at hand
- Social media not a monolithic thing
 - Therefore not a single solution
- Solutions
 - Collecting strategies
 - Existing ethical standards in our own profession [Toolkit](URL)
 - Existing literature, like medical and social sciences [@cazzerson](@cazzerson)
 - Open science and research data sharing
 - Model our approach on existing standards our universities are developing for dealing with sensitive data
- For instance, see NC State's "Determining Sensitivity Levels for Shared Data" [https://oit.ncsu.edu/it-security/data-framework/determining-sensitivity-levels-for-shared-data/#personal](https://oit.ncsu.edu/it-security/data-framework/determining-sensitivity-levels-for-shared-data/#personal)

## Collecting Strategies
Collecting practices might inform the sort of ethical decisions institutions will be faced with
- Three pronged approach
 - Institutional records
 - Donated data
 - Data relevant to our existing collecting strategies and community (largely)
 - Maybe cite prelimary evidence from MHL survey v/v support from campus members supporting contributing to the archives, ie, university's historic record

## Table 1. Label
| Factor | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Institutional record | Green |
| Owned and donated by existing donor | Yellow |
| Relation to existing collections | Yellow |
| At risk population | Red |
| Sensitive data[1] | Red |
| Illegal activity | Purple |
| etc | etc |
[1] As defined by one's institution.

## Table 2. Label

| Color | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Purple | Restrict for N years, seek consent, researcher non-disclosure |
| Red | Obfuscate,[2] seek consent, researcher non-disclosure |
| Yellow | Researcher non-disclosure, opt-out, consider other factors |
| Green | Freely available, no consent required |
[2] Obfuscation over anonymization, as the latter has been shown to be impossible [cite](URLs) Methods: Distortion, aggregation

## Conclusion
- Gross over-simplifications, in a way
- Each institution makes its own assessment
 - Sliding scale, not proscriptive
 - Should confer with legal counsel
 - Ethical, risk assessments
 - Existing donor relations to consider
 - Perceived historical significance may trump certain concerns
- Also develop collecting guidelines that make sense v/v your existing collections / collecting strategies
- Seek guidance from community members, where appropriate
